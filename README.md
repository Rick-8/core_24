> ## Manual & Python Testing

I did manual testing to verify that the website functions as expected by executing test cases without using automation tools. This approach is essential for identifying usability issues, unexpected errors, and verifying workflows from a user perspective. at every step of the way throughout the development process. 

For my core 24 gym project, I performed manual testing by:

 - Navigating through the site to ensure all pages load correctly.
 - Testing user authentication, including login, logout, and account creation.
 - Booking system validation, where I attempted to book slots under various conditions to confirm the 50-booking limit.
 - Checking form validations to ensure required fields and error messages function correctly.
 - Admin panel functionality testing, ensuring staff could manage users and reset passwords.
 - These tests helped identify and resolve issues such as incorrect file paths and permission-related errors.

**Python Testing**

To ensure stability and correctness in my project, I implemented Python-based testing using Django’s built-in TestCase module. This allowed me to write automated unit and integration tests for critical functionalities, including:

 - User authentication tests to verify login, registration, and password reset functions.
 - Booking system tests to check that users cannot exceed the daily booking limit.
 - Database integrity tests to confirm correct data storage and retrieval.

I ran these tests using Django’s test framework with the command: python manage.py test


## Code Submission: The code was submitted to the CI tool for automated style checking.

![Ci linter pep8 faults](assets/images/screenshot-%20ciplinter-errors-list.webp)

**Review and Corrections:**
- Long lines exceeding 79 characters were identified and broken into multiple 
  lines using parentheses.
- Indentation errors and spacing issues were corrected.
- Blank lines removed

**Final Check: After making corrections, the code was re-submitted to ensure it passed all checks.**

![Ci linter fault free](assets/images/tc-ci-linter-error-free.webp)

## Development Testing

During the initial program development and testing phases, it was observed that error's were coming up as I went along here are the main issues found:

***Use of the Clear Screen Function***

- During initial testing, I observed that the terminal output resembled a continuous log, quickly becoming cluttered and overwhelming.

- To enhance readability and improve the user experience, I implemented a clear screen function. This function is utilized in menu navigation and certain program features to 
  keep the display clean and organized.

***Incorporating time.sleep(2) and Input Pauses***

Reason for Adding time.sleep(2)

- messages and prompts often disappeared too quickly, especially when the program transitioned back to the previous menu. This made it difficult for users to read and  
  understand the messages before the screen was cleared or the next menu appeared.

- To address this issue, I added time.sleep(2) pauses after certain error messages and user prompts. This function temporarily halts the execution of the program for 2 seconds, 
  giving users sufficient time to read the displayed messages.

Implementation of time.sleep(2)
The time.sleep function was imported from Python’s built-in **time** library at the beginning of the program.

***Adding "Press Enter to Continue" Prompts***

- In addition to time.sleep(2), I added "Press Enter to continue" prompts in sections where users might require more time, such as after viewing stock or exchange rates.
  This  ensures that users can take as much time as they need before moving on.

Example:
input("\nPress Enter to return to the previous menu...\n")

***Functions Revert Back to the Main Menu***

- When using set functions further inside the program, when either an invalid input or the program had completed its task it would revert back to the main menu.

- To fix this I updated the code to revert back to the previous menu or try again depending of the task at hand.

## Systematic Testing

The following tests were carried out to ensure the program operated as intended, ironing out errors at every stage.

**Invalid menu option in the main menu**

![Main menu error test](assets/images/tc-ie-main%20menu.webp)

**Invalid currency input**

![Input error test](assets/images/tc-ie-currency-input-error.webp)

**Non-numeric input for currency amount**

![Non numeric input error](assets/images/tc-ie-currency-non-numeric.webp)

**Purchasing more currency than available**

**Correct transaction flow**

**Admin panel password verification**

**Exit options in customer and admin panels**
